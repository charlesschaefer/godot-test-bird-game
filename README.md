# Godot Test Bird Game

This is a small game made using Godot 2D engine, where you need to help an airport to detect birds flying around.

It was made as a test and learning process of both the engine and a proof of concept of reaction time measurement for a game idea for ADHD patients.

This can be considered an implementation of the Stop Signal Task (LOGAN, 1984).

Assets were made using OpenAI's Dall-e platform.
